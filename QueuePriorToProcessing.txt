Queue  --- FIFO: First In First Out

Prior to Processing, if we want to represent a group of objects then we should 
go for Queue

Example: 
Before sending sms message all mobile no we have to store in some Data Structures.
In which order we added mobile no, in the same order only message should be send.
For this FIFO requirement purpose, Queue is the best choice

Usually, Queue follows First In First Out order.
But based on our requirement we can implement our own priority order also(Priority Queue)

LinkedList class also implements Queue Interface

LinkedList base implementation of Queue always follows First In First Out order
